1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,000
这里空气可供呼吸
The atmosphere is breathable.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,540
布卡坦没错 曼达洛星没遭到诅咒
Bo-Katan was right. Mandalore is not cursed.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,160
(前情提要)

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,040
布卡坦奎兹要出去 把其他流亡的曼达洛人带过来
Bo-Katan Kryze is going off to bring other Mandalorians in exile to us

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,450
让我们同胞再次团结
so that we may join together once again.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,000
收复曼达洛星的时间到了
It is time to retake Mandalore.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,120
你来加入佣兵吗
Have you come back to join the mercenaries?

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,290
我来收回我的舰队
I've come to reclaim my fleet.

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,200
我们曼达洛人不该再自相残杀了
Enough Mandalorian blood has been spilled by our own hands.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,120
曼达洛统治者必须持有黑剑
The ruler of Mandalore must possess the Darksaber.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,620
我在探索曼达洛星时被抓住
While exploring Mandalore, I was captured.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,790
这把剑也被抢走
And this blade was taken from me.

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,290
布卡坦救了我并且宰了抓捕者
Bo-Katan rescued me and slayed my captor.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
我在此把剑物归原主
I return this blade to its rightful owner.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,200
我发现废弃的新共和国穿梭机
I found a derelict New Republic shuttle.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,620
这是劫囚
This was an extraction.

17
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,540
时间符合吉迪恩星区长的囚船
Flight times match the ship transporting Moff Gideon.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,750
我就知道 他没去受审
I knew it. He never made it to trial.

19
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,450
似乎有什么东西卡在舱壁
There appears to be something embedded in the cabin wall.

20
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,910
那是贝斯卡合金的碎片
It's a fragment of beskar alloy.

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,290
拜托 你陷害我
Please. You set me up.

22
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,080
代码TK2755
Code T-K-2-7-5-5.

23
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,790
报告 简短些 我赶时间
Report. And make it quick, as I am short on time.

24
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,370
长官 海盗在内瓦罗星遇到麻烦
Sir, I'm afraid the pirates have run into trouble on Nevarro.

25
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,660
你上次的报告
In your last report,

26
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,500
不是说新共和国不会派人去支援吗
didn't you suggest that the New Republic would not be sending support?

27
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,870
不是新共和国
It wasn't the New Republic.

28
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,290
卡加太守有一群曼达洛人相助
Magistrate Karga was aided by Mandalorians.

29
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,620
哪些曼达洛人
Which Mandalorians?

30
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,160
根据新共和国收到的报告
According to the reports received by the New Republic,

31
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,660
布卡坦奎兹带领一队曼达洛人
Bo-Katan Kryze lead a squadron of Mandalorians

32
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,580
连同丁贾林和那群躲藏的同党
alongside Din Djarin and his covert.

33
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,620
不可能 这两派人是死对头
This cannot be. Those two factions are sworn enemies.

34
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,830
所以我才急忙联络你
Which is why I contacted you with haste.

35
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,870
你的任务别停
Continue with your mission.

36
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,870
我来处理那些曼达洛人
I shall deal with our Mandalorian friends.

37
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,620
新共和国很脆弱
The New Republic is vulnerable,

38
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,160
但我们必须谨慎 别显露出实力
but we must be cautious and show no sign of our true strength.

39
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,040
你说得倒轻松 舰长
Easy for you to say, Captain.

40
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,500
劫掠超太空通道可以赚到不少钱
There's a fortune to be had plundering the hyperspace lanes.

41
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,410
指挥官 你的打带跑行动太引人注目
Commander, your hit-and-run operations are gaining too much notice.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,450
如果别人发觉我们不只是 一群无组织的余党军阀
If we are perceived as anything other than a group of unorganized remnant warlords,

43
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,580
新共和国会更着力追捕我们
the New Republic will increase their efforts to hunt us down.

44
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:28,290
银河各星球都有忠于帝国的人民
There are citizens loyal to the Empire on every planet in this galaxy.

45
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,080
他们已经开始厌倦了新共和国
They're already getting sick of this New Republic

46
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,200
和那些规章制度
and its rules and regulations.

47
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,160
只要展现力量 他们将再度支持我们
And if we give them a show of strength, they will rally behind us.

48
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,450
没错
Yes.

49
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,450
但这股力量不能浪费
But that strength must not be wasted.

50
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,040
索龙元帅的归来
Grand Admiral Thrawn's return

51
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,580
将会宣告我军的正式回归
will herald in the reemergence of our military,

52
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,870
并且给赫斯司令 足够的时间执行死灵计划
and provide Commandant Hux enough time to deliver on Project Necromancer.

53
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,910
裴里昂舰长 你的发言总是如此权威
Captain Pellaeon, you always speak with much authority,

54
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,950
但这次还是一样
and yet, I see,  once again,

55
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,330
你的代表团里没看见索龙元帅的身影
that Grand Admiral Thrawn is missing from your delegation.

56
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,830
能告诉我们他何时能参加影子议会吗
Any word on when he will be able to participate in the Shadow Council?

57
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:27,540
恕我直言 如果我们想成功 他的回归就必须保密
With respect, our one hope for success relies upon the secrecy of his return.

58
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,910
舰长 刺探秘密是我的专长
Captain, secrets are my stock-in-trade.

59
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,330
我能听见银河各角落的传闻
I hear whispers from one end of the galaxy to another,

60
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,700
却没听过索龙的消息
and never a word of Thrawn.

61
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,500
你老是说他即将回归
You have spoken of his imminent return.

62
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,910
或许这时我们也该指望新的领导
Perhaps, it's time we look to new leadership.

63
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,040
赞成
Hear, hear.

64
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,040
死灵计画已为此做好准备
Project Necromancer is in place for that.

65
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,410
是的 司令
Yes, Commandant.

66
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,450
珀欣博士在哪里  还有你答应过的研究呢
What has become of Doctor Pershing and the research you promised us?

67
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,700
珀欣博士被新共和国俘虏
Doctor Pershing was captured by the New Republic.

68
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,040
他的研究内容消失了
His research is lost.

69
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,250
至少目前是如此
For now, at least.

70
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,910
吉迪恩 我也听到传闻
I also hear whispers, Gideon.

71
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,870
听说珀欣在你手上 你自己还想在内瓦罗做实验
You held Pershing and were attempting your own experiments on Nevarro.

72
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,160
执着于生产复制人的是你 不是我
The creation of clones is your obsession, not mine.

73
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,870
我对我星区的事负责 不多也不少
I account for what goes on in my sector, no more, no less.

74
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,910
这话也适用于本议会所有成员
The same can be said of every member of this Council.

75
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,540
-是的 -当然
- Yes. - Of course.

76
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,040
-没错 -是的
- That's right. - Yes.

77
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,330
然而我们各自努力搜刮资源
And yet, we individually scrape and claw resources

78
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,620
等着宏大计画成形
awaiting the grand plan to take shape,

79
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,040
同时你和裴里昂却累积无数资源与设备
while you and Pellaeon amass countless resources

80
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,660
那些本该与大家共享
and equipment which should be shared.

81
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,080
我们已经收到你的请求
Oh, we already received your request.

82
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,040
「三名禁卫军」
"Three Praetorian Guards."

83
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,660
似乎有人担心会遭到刺杀
Sounds like someone is concerned about an assassination attempt.

84
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,410
那人还好意思觉得我浮夸
And he thinks I'm being the flashy one.

85
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,080
并且强化你的钛拦截机中队
And reinforcements for your TIE interceptor squadron.

86
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,250
还有...轰炸机
And... bombers.

87
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,080
我知道
Yes, I see.

88
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,700
你有什么安全顾虑
And what is your security concern?

89
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,080
曼达洛人
Mandalorians.

90
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,950
什么
What?

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,160
-他们仍然是问题吗  -是的
- They continue to be an issue? - They do.

92
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,620
我越来越坚信
I am increasingly confident

93
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,580
他们正准备收复家园曼达洛星
that they are preparing to retake their home world of Mandalore.

94
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,250
曼达洛的复兴有碍我们发展
A resurgent Mandalore would hamper our efforts.

95
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,500
所以我们必须立刻扫除他们
Which is why we need to stamp them out now.

96
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,160
没错
Yes.

97
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,950
我们会给你增援
You'll have your reinforcements.

98
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,450
还有护卫
And your guard.

99
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:13,080
我们将彻底铲除曼达洛人
We shall be rid of the Mandalorians once and for all.

100
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,540
帝国万岁
Long Live the Empire! Long Live the Empire!

101
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,540
曼达洛人
第三季第七集

102
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,540
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

103
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,660
《第二十三章:探察者》

104
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,620
上太守 上太守
High Magistrate! High Magistrate!

105
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,250
一艘帝国穿梭机飞越城市上空
An Imperial shuttle is advancing over the city.

106
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,410
第一 那是轻型巡航舰 第二 那不是帝国的
First, that's a light cruiser. And second, it's not Imperial.

107
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,330
抱歉 长官 我的资料显示它是
With apologies, sir. According to my data, it is.

108
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,830
现在不是帝国的船了 你看那标志
No, no. It was an Imperial ship. Look at the markings.

109
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,910
朋友 他们是曼达洛民兵
See, those, my friend, are Mandalorian privateers.

110
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,370
我敢说那舰队有一半是从帝国抢来的
I'll bet you, half that fleet was captured from the Empire.

111
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,870
所以他们跟我们同一国
So, they're on our side then?

112
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,290
希望是这样
I should hope so.

113
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,830
我们去迎接客人 来吧
They're our welcomed guests. Come.

114
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,620
希望这两群人和睦相处
I hope these two groups get along.

115
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,950
他们没见过面
They've never met,

116
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,700
只知道彼此憎恶对方
and what little they know of each other, they hate.

117
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,040
他们想活就得和睦
They will if they wanna survive.

118
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,450
带孩子们进去
Take the children inside.

119
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,950
欢迎 曼达洛伙伴
Welcome, fellow Mandalorians.

120
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,250
我们邀请各位扎营
We invite you to make camp.

121
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,950
大家准备设宴款待客人
Let us prepare a feast for our guests.

122
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,910
老曼
Mando!

123
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,200
欢迎回来 我的朋友
Welcome back, my friend. Welcome back.

124
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,250
你召集的舰队真不赖
That's quite a fleet you've assembled.

125
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,620
一点小礼 欢迎我们的新邻居
Little welcome gift to celebrate our new neighbors.

126
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,370
来自远方的科罗森
That's all the way from Coruscant,

127
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,950
建议你等人少一点的时候再打开
so you might wanna wait for a smaller gathering before you open it.

128
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,330
-谢谢 -我还有别的礼物送你
- Thank you. - That's not the only gift I have for you.

129
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,120
你对IG-11做了什么
What did you do to IG-11?

130
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,540
他现在是IG-12 你喜欢他吗
No, that's IG-12 now. Do you like him?

131
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,500
我喜欢他吗
Do I like him?

132
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,040
别担心 他很安全
Don't worry. He's safe.

133
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,660
你确定
You're sure?

134
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,080
安泽人把IG拆到只剩基本机动功能
Well, the Anzellans stripped IG down to his base motor functions.

135
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,200
他们移除他的记忆体电路
They removed his memory circuit.

136
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,290
由驾驶来充当大脑
The pilot provides cognition.

137
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,660
是
Yes.

138
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,580
这样想吧 它更像是交通工具
Think of it this way. It's more like a vehicle. Hmm?

139
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,200
这样比较安全
It's safer that way.

140
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,790
坏宝宝 别挤
Bad baby. No squeezie!

141
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,500
他太小 不适合操控
Well, he's too little to operate this thing.

142
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,750
别急着否决 先试乘看看
No, no, no, no. Let's see if he fits.

143
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,580
你觉得呢
So what do you think?

144
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,120
我会说他们做得很好
They do nice work, I'll give them that.

145
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,000
但古古太小 不能操作重型机械
But, Grogu is too young to operate heavy machinery.

146
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,620
等他大一点吧
- Maybe when he's older.

147
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,540
不
No.

148
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,870
-什么叫「不」  -不
- What do you mean, "No?" No.

149
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,830
我猜他是说他够大 能操作了
I think he's sayin' he's old enough to operate it.

150
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,870
是
Yes.

151
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,950
-拎他出来 -不
- Get him out of there. - No.

152
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,450
至少让他在我办公室试驾
No, at least let him try it out in my office.

153
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,450
是
Yes.

154
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,290
不 这主意不好 出来
No, this is not a good idea. Come on.

155
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,910
你看到没
Will you look at that?

156
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,500
是
Yes.

157
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,660
「是」什么
"Yes" what?

158
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:02,120
是...是
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

159
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:18,700
是...是
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

160
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,620
你做什么
What are you doing?

161
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,450
住手 古古 不行 那要付钱的
Stop, Grogu. No. You have to pay for those.

162
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,200
-不行 古古 -是 不
- No. Hey. Grogu. - Yes. No.

163
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,540
-拿来 -不
- Give it. - No.

164
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,870
古古 还回去...
- Grogu, give it ba...

165
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,250
给你
Here.

166
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,290
我认为这行不通
This isn't working for me.

167
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,120
曼达洛人
BO-KATAN: Mandalorians.

168
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,620
收复我们家园的时候到了
It is time to retake our home world.

169
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,660
尽管星球没被诅咒 依然很危险
Even though the planet is not cursed, there are still dangers.

170
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,580
蛰伏的种族被轰炸唤醒
Dormant species have been awakened from the bombings.

171
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,750
残余的磁干扰
The remaining magnetic interference

172
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,450
导致无法从大气层上方扫描地表
has made it impossible to scan the surface from above atmosphere.

173
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,250
所以我提议我们离开内瓦罗
Which is why I'm proposing that we leave Nevarro

174
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,910
带舰队进入曼达洛星上方的轨道
and move the fleet into orbit above Mandalore.

175
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,000
我们派小型侦察队下去
We send down a small recon party.

176
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,500
搜索地表
We'll scout the surface,

177
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,750
找出大锻造厂的遗迹 建立安全阵地
find out what remains of the Great Forge, and establish a safe perimeter.

178
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,160
然后才能带其他人下去
Only then, will we bring down the others.

179
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,040
我需要包含两部族的自愿者
I need volunteers from both tribes.

180
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,160
我愿意去
I will go.

181
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,160
还有古古
Grogu as well.

182
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,330
我愿意去
I will go.

183
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,950
我愿意去
I will go.

184
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,450
我愿意去
I will go.

185
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,830
我愿意去
I will go.

186
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,830
我愿意去
I will go.

187
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,660
我愿意去
I will go.

188
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,290
-我愿意去 -我愿意去
- I will go. - I will go.

189
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,580
我也愿意去
I will go as well.

190
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,700
派出侦察队到地表
Scouting party descending to surface.

191
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,000
通讯很快就会中断
We'll lose comms shortly.

192
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,870
比我想得还糟
It's worse than I thought.

193
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,160
事发时我在现场
I was here when it happened.

194
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,830
他们准备好了
They're ready.

195
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,660
确保渗透区安全
Secure infil zone.

196
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,200
手甲战机 降落区安全
Gauntlet, landing zone secure.

197
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,500
下面某处是我们以前的古老都城
Somewhere below is where our ancient capital once stood.

198
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,790
先探勘地表 找到锻造厂并建立安全区
We'll survey the surface until we find the Forge and create a safety zone.

199
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,750
然后才能带其他人下来定居
Only then will we begin to bring down the settlers.

200
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,910
从那个方向开始侦察
We start scouting in that direction.

201
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,700
列队
Form up.

202
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,790
那边 地平线上
There, on the horizon.

203
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,080
夜鸮
Nite Owls.

204
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,000
左侧加强
Flanking left.

205
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,580
你们有吃的吗
Do you have food?

206
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,410
有的
We do.

207
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,700
你穿戴夜鸮纹饰的盔甲
You wear the crest of the Nite Owls?

208
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,950
我希望是的
I should hope so.

209
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,290
他们是曼达洛人
They're Mandalorians.

210
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,950
那是布卡坦奎兹小姐的声音
Is that the voice of Lady Bo-Katan Kryze?

211
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,040
是的
It is.

212
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,040
你果然没抛弃我们 布卡坦小姐
We knew you would not forsake us, Lady Bo-Katan.

213
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,660
我们辜负了你 但我们依然会为你奋战
We have failed you, but our blasters remain in your service.

214
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,080
他们看到有飞船离开就拦下
They intercepted any ships they saw leaving.

215
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,620
他们不留俘虏
They took no prisoners.

216
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,950
他们把全地表轰炸了两轮
They bombed every surface twice over.

217
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,660
他们惩罚我们 用来警告全银河
They punished us as a warning to the whole galaxy

218
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,790
因为我们拒绝投降
because we refused to surrender.

219
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,450
不对
That's not true.

220
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,580
我当时投降了
I did surrender.

221
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,120
我们的部队在千泪之夜被歼灭后
After our forces were annihilated in the Night of a Thousand Tears

222
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,290
眼看大势已去
and defeat was imminent,

223
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,790
我见了吉迪恩星区长
I met with Moff Gideon.

224
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,750
帝防局联络我 说要协议停火
The ISB had reached out to me to negotiate a cease-fire.

225
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,330
只要屈服于帝国且放下武器
In exchange for submitting to the Empire and disarming,

226
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,950
就饶了剩余的城市与曼达洛人
all remaining cities and Mandalorian lives were to be spared.

227
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,950
因此吉迪恩星区长才得到黑剑
That is how Moff Gideon came to possess the Darksaber.

228
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,200
我不信任他
I didn't trust him,

229
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,450
但那是我挽救同胞唯一的机会
but it was the only chance I had to save our people.

230
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,160
他却背信弃义
And then he betrayed me

231
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,410
我们也无力抵抗曼达洛大肃清了
and we were helpless to resist the Purge of Mandalore.

232
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,000
这些人是如何生存的
How did these others survive?

233
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,120
我们躲藏在康果狄亚卫星
We were hidden on the moon of Concordia.

234
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,290
你们是死神护卫
Are you Death Watch?

235
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,950
死神护卫不存在了
Death Watch exists no longer.

236
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,080
分裂成许多派互相交战
It shattered into many warring factions.

237
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,870
我们的同胞反复受难
Our people have suffered time and again.

238
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,500
因为分裂与派系之争
From division and squabbling factions.

239
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,910
曼达洛星一向十分强大 从无敌手
Mandalore has always been too powerful for any enemy to defeat.

240
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,450
往往是内部的分裂把我们给毁了
It is always our own division that destroys us.

241
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,250
我本来不知道
I had no idea.

242
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,660
我们学到的是只剩我们没背弃正道
We were taught that everyone but us had forsaken the Way.

243
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,120
还有你们很自私且不在乎
That you were selfish and uncaring.

244
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,080
现在我明白了
Now I understand.

245
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,040
你说得对
You were right.

246
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,290
我是很自私
I was selfish.

247
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,700
造成了这种结果
And this is what it wrought.

248
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,700
我们会重建
We'll rebuild it.

249
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,910
就像我们的历史
Isn't that our history?

250
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,080
数千年来 我们一直濒临灭绝
For thousands of years, we have been on the verge of extinction,

251
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,450
而数千年来 我们都存活着
and for thousands of years, we have survived.

252
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,450
我不确定我能否让大家齐心
I don't know if I can keep everyone together.

253
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,620
太多仇恨了
There's too much animosity.

254
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,080
这把剑是我团结人民的唯一倚仗
And this blade is all I have to unify our people.

255
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,830
我是听你说才知道这把武器
I only know of this weapon what you taught me.

256
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,370
老实说我们那派没当它是一回事
To be honest, it means nothing to me or my people.

257
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,620
身分和血统也不重要
Nor does station or bloodline.

258
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,910
我更看重的是荣誉
What means more to me is honor.

259
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,200
还有忠诚与人格
And loyalty. And character.

260
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,540
我是因此才为你效力 奎兹小姐
These are the reasons I serve you, Lady Kryze.

261
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,370
你的歌谣还没写成
Your song is not yet written.

262
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,580
在此之前 我都供你差遣
I will serve you until it is.

263
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,450
今晚休息 天一亮再继续
We'll rest tonight and continue at first light.

264
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,080
这些人太虚弱 无法参与
These here are too weak to continue.

265
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,660
必须返回手甲战机
We must return to the Gauntlet

266
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,330
明天我会送他们回舰队
and I will ferry them back to the fleet in the morning.

267
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,370
同意
Agreed.

268
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,910
队长
Captain?

269
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,410
你们体力够的
Those of you who are well enough

270
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,540
就一起来找大锻造厂
can join us in the search for the Great Forge.

271
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,120
有更好的办法
We can do better than that.

272
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,040
直接带你们过去
We can bring you there.

273
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,660
前进 曼达洛人 前往锻造厂
Onward, Mandalorians! To the Forge!

274
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,660
执行者不能这样走
You can't move an Enforcer like that.

275
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,330
那是侧跳 你准备屈服吧
It's a flank jump. And you're about to submit.

276
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,660
但只有翔卫可以侧跳
But only the Wing Guard can flank jump.

277
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,330
执行者在两侧的移动比照翔卫
The Enforcer moves like a Wing Guard when it's flanking.

278
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,080
这些原始人什么规则都自己编造
These primitives make up their own rules for everything.

279
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,500
认真的吗
Seriously?

280
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,330
屈服或战斗
Submit or fight.

281
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,870
你敢相信吗
Can you believe this?

282
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,660
我该插手吗
Should I step in?

283
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,540
两边都无法插手
Neither side can step in.

284
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,660
迟早都会起冲突的
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

285
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:04,450
不...不
No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

286
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,830
你教的好徒儿
You taught your apprentice well.

287
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,080
那不是跟我学的
He didn't learn that from me.

288
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,000
呼叫舰队指挥部
Come in, Fleet Command.

289
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,950
请说
We read you.

290
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:52,250
准备收置获救的幸存者 他们需要医护
Prepare to receive rescued survivors in need of medical attention.

291
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,450
收到 手甲战机
Copy, Gauntlet.

292
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,200
那边 在右舷前方
There, on the starboard bow!

293
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,750
弃船
Abandon ship!

294
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,450
我们走
Let's go!

295
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,410
这边 这边
This way! This way!

296
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,830
赶快 快点
Hurry up! Faster!

297
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,620
还行吗
You good?

298
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,370
不远了 还要再往下
We're not far. We need to go further down.

299
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,790
走...走
Go, go, go.

300
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,000
走...走
Go! Go, go!

301
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,040
这是哪里
Where are we?

302
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,500
这是大锻造厂的残骸
This is what's left of the Great Forge.

303
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,080
这曾是我们文明的核心
This was once the heart of our civilization.

304
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,200
但自从轰炸之后 火就熄了
But the fires have been extinguished since the bombings.

305
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,700
你住在这里
You lived here?

306
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,120
我们都是
We all did.

307
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,290
我们没离开
We never left.

308
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,000
沿着地表迁徙求生 直到战争结束
Survived by migrating along the surface until the war ended.

309
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,080
有人往下探索 但没人生还
Some tried to explore below, but none survived.

310
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,830
喷射背包
Jet packs?

311
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,200
其他幸存者
More survivors?

312
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,660
他们不是曼达洛人
Those aren't Mandalorians.

313
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,370
-是帝国的人 -找掩护
They're Imperials! Take cover.

314
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,700
他们身穿贝斯卡装甲
They're wearing beskar armor!

315
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,790
我们被包围了 需要支援
We're pinned down. We need backup.

316
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,290
我可以前往舰队带援军过来
I can make a run for the fleet and get us reinforcements.

317
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,700
不 太远了
No, it's too far.

318
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,500
我行的 为了收复星球必须一搏
I can make it. It's our only shot at taking the planet back.

319
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,830
那边天花板有裂缝
There's a split in the ceiling there.

320
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,700
我掩护你
I'll lay down cover.

321
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,910
他们撤退了
They're retreating!

322
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:06,410
-前进 -为了曼达洛
Advance. For Mandalore!

323
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,500
孩子 你要跟上
Okay, kid. You've gotta keep up.

324
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,370
这是什么地方
What is this place?

325
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,000
有埋伏
It's an ambush.

326
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,660
没收他的武器
Disarm him.

327
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,750
多亏你将曼达洛人聚在一处
Thank you for gathering the Mandalorians into one place.

328
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,750
你们很有本事 但你们的时代结束了
You were a talented people, but your time has passed.

329
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:15,750
不过 如你所见 曼达洛星将由我统治
However, as you can see, Mandalore will live on in me.

330
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:20,000
多亏这星球的丰富资源
Thanks to your planet's rich resources,

331
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,080
我打造了新一代的黑暗兵装甲
I have created the next generation Dark Trooper suit

332
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,500
以贝斯卡合金锻造
forged from beskar alloy.

333
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:36,000
最优异的改进之处就是将我放在里面
And the most impressive improvement is that it has me in it.

334
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,080
每个社群都能有所贡献
You see, every society has something to offer.

335
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,660
复制科学家 绝地
The cloners. The Jedi.

336
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,250
连曼达洛人也不例外
And even the Mandalorians.

337
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,790
透过结合各家所长
By aggregating the best of each,

338
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:54,700
我创造出的军队将足以恢复银河秩序
I will create an army that will bring order to the galaxy.

339
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,410
我要歼灭你们的舰队
Why don't we take your fleet off the board

340
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
趁现在发动奇袭
while we still have the element of surprise.

341
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,660
派出拦截机和轰炸机
Activate the interceptors and bombers.

342
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,700
不
No!

343
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,330
不用多久 曼达洛大肃清就能彻底完成
In but a few moments, the Purge of Mandalore will be complete.

344
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,080
带他到汇报室
Take him to the debriefing room.

345
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,580
我早该把握机会杀了你
I should have killed you when I had the chance.

346
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,500
布卡坦
Bo-Katan.

347
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,450
下次别再像这样见面
We have to stop meeting like this.

348
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,660
不会再有下次
I'll make sure of it.

349
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,950
我们就闲话少说了
Let's skip the pleasantries, shall we?

350
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,830
我认为这时候
I believe this is the part

351
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,870
你该将黑剑交还原主
where you return the Darksaber to its rightful owner.

352
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,450
现在 交出黑剑
Now, surrender the Darksaber,

353
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,950
告诉他们这星球是我的
and tell these people that this planet is mine.

354
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,330
我辈之道
This is the Way.

355
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,120
打开防爆门
Open the blast doors.

356
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,410
杀了他们
Kill them.

357
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,450
-走吧 -快走
Move out! Move out!

358
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,540
撤退 我掩护后方
Fall back! I'll cover the rear!

359
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,120
快走
Go, go, go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

360
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,000
可以走了 撤退
We're clear. Fall back.

361
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:10,160
快来 我们不会丢下你
Come on. We're not leaving you behind.

362
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,000
走吧 太多了
Go. There are too many.

363
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,120
不
No!

364
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,580
我辈之道
This is the Way.

365
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,120

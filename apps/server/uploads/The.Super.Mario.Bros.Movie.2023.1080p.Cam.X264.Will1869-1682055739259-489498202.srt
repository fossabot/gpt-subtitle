170
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:08,791
Sick and tired of feeling so small.

171
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:10,597
A water main burst underground today.

172
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:13,743
Stopping subway service
and flooding downtown Brooklyn.

173
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:15,870
Everything is under control,
I promise you.

174
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,630
- We are very close to fixing this.
- <i>PIPELINE FAILURE FLOODS BROOKLYN</i>

175
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,403
- Out of the way!
- It's alright!

176
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:20,348
Somebody help!

177
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,215
Somebody save Brooklyn!

178
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,208
Save Brooklyn?

179
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:25,581
Luigi...

180
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,298
This is our chance!

181
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:28,843
Destiny is calling!

182
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:30,965
Destiny del Monchu
from high school?

183
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,591
What?

184
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:32,363
No!

185
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:33,685
Just come on.

186
00:13:46,313 --> 00:13:47,593
I got this.

187
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,566
They're not even
looking in the right place.

188
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:52,726
Come on, Lou.

189
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:04,036
You are not seriously considering...

190
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:05,721
Mario!

191
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,651
We got to get to
that pressure valve.

192
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:21,004
Mario, really?

193
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:03,345
I knew saving Brooklyn was a bad idea.

194
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,583
Come on.

195
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:13,076
Woah!

196
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:17,178
What is this place?

197
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,477
Looks like nobody's been
down here for years.

198
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:53,996
Luigi?

199
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,309
Luigi, are you in there?

200
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:05,690
Luigi!

201
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,213
What?

202
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,928
Luigi!

203
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:43,138
Mario!

204
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:48,312
Gimme your hand!

205
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,130
It's all gonna be okay!

206
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:51,737
How is this gonna be okay?!

207
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:52,687
I'm telling you!

208
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,250
Nothing can hurt us,
as long as we're together!

209
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,893
Mario!

210
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:03,216
Luigi!

211
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:42,352
Do not touch that mushroom!
You'll die!

212
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:44,651
Oh, I'm sorry.

213
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,104
That one's perfectly fine.

214
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:47,790
Ah, it's a little mushroom man.

215
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:49,696
A little mushroom man,
talking to me.

216
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:50,654
Pleased to meet ya!

217
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:51,910
I'm Toad.

218
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,900
Uh, Mario.

219
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:58,630
So this uh...

220
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:01,035
This is, this is not a dream?

221
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,890
That hurt, right?

222
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:02,875
Yes!

223
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,173
Definitely, not a dream.

224
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:05,685
Then, then...

225
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,551
- This place is...
- The Mushroom Kingdom!

226
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:11,270
Mushrooms, really?

227
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:12,981
Now, that is a cruel twist of fate.

228
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:19,911
Hello.

229
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:23,619
Yeah, I'm actually looking for somebody.

230
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,901
My brother, in fact.

231
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:28,019
He looks exactly like me,
but tall, and skinny, and green.

232
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:30,665
See, last time I saw him,
he was falling through a pipe.

233
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,890
It was foggy and I believe there was lava.

234
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,496
Uh, that is not good.

235
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Umm...

236
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:40,875
Your brother has landed in the Dark Lands.

237
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,028
They're under Bowser's control.

238
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:45,710
Bowser?

239
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:49,281
He's the most evil,
wretched creature alive.

240
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:55,325
I'm taking you to see the princess.

241
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,300
She can help.

242
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:57,933
She can do anything.

243
00:18:58,376 --> 00:18:59,810
Princess?

244
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,937
Come on, Mario!

245
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:08,300
Our big adventure begins now!

246
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:09,764
Hang on, Luigi.

247
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,725
Mario?

248
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:40,164
Mario?

249
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:41,500
Where are you?

250
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:43,882
Huh?

251
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,368
Haha!

252
00:20:24,393 --> 00:20:25,410
Yes!

253
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:28,290
You just got a-Luigi'd.

254
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:46,508
This way, Mario!

255
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:49,080
The princess is right up that hill.

256
00:21:58,259 --> 00:21:59,767
Excuse me, everybody.
Coming through.

257
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,548
Got a big adventure happening, right now.

258
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:03,228
Clear a path for us.

259
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:04,346
- If I could just...
- Here you go.

260
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:05,540
Excuse me.

261
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:08,060
Excuse me, everybody!
Coming through!

262
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:11,496
This guy's brother is
going to die imminently!

263
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:12,661
Out of the way, please!

264
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:14,312
Just trying to clear a path.
That's all I'm doing.

265
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:15,621
He's gonna be fine.

266
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:16,692
- Shake Shroom!
- Morning!

267
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:18,245
Nice to see ya, bud.

268
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,293
Does this thing work?

269
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:23,233
Yeah, it works great.

270
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,397
Hey, you just have to blow into it.

271
00:22:26,065 --> 00:22:27,970
And...
Up, we go.

272
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:29,168
Wait, up?

273
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,668
Okay, so these bricks
are just floating here?

274
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:54,633
Just pop in this pipe
and we're on our way.

275
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,376
The only way to fly, man.

276
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:01,333
Oh, wow.
Love these pipes.

277
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,650
Aw, come on!

278
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:29,871
Here we are.

279
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:30,642
Palace doors.

280
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:31,690
Bing, bang, boom.

281
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,178
Come on, haha.

282
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:37,536
Woo!

283
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,103
Woah.

284
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:47,658
Pretty impressive,
am I right?

285
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:53,199
Hold it right there, you two.

286
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,060
Oh, hey.

287
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:56,137
I need to see the princess.

288
00:23:56,162 --> 00:23:57,310
It's an emergency.

289
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:00,748
What princess?

290
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,648
I never heard of any princess.

291
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:03,766
Oh, wait.
I did.

292
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,066
Our princess, though,
is in another castle.

293
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,479
Oh, yeah. That's right.

294
00:24:07,503 --> 00:24:09,351
You should try
another castle, maybe.

295
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,328
She ain't in this one.

296
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:12,091
Huh?

297
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:13,943
Okay, so they're
messing with you.

298
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:14,660
And...

299
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:16,018
I don't like it.

300
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,055
What do you guys, um...

301
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,280
What you wanna eat?

302
00:24:22,305 --> 00:24:24,131
Anything your heart desires.

303
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:24,777
Go!

304
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:27,289
And we're gonna scramble it up.

305
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:36,725
- Hey!
- Intruder!

306
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,125
Stop him!

307
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:40,315
- Intruder!
- Stop him!

308
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,228
Back to work!
We know!

309
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:43,671
Stop him!

310
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:00,280
Council, your attention!

311
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:04,858
Bowser has found the Super Star
and is headed toward our Kingdom.

312
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:07,951
Its power will
make him invincible.

313
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:09,983
We will be destroyed.

314
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:14,606
Princess, what are we gonna do?

315
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:16,897
I will not let him hurt you.

316
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,311
We are going to stop Bowser.

317
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:26,077
How?

318
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:27,062
Look at us...

319
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:28,710
We're adorable.

320
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:32,677
I'm going to convince the
great Kong Army to help us.

321
00:25:32,702 --> 00:25:35,640
Together, we'll annihilate that monster.

322
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:38,375
Their mad king doesn't make alliances.

323
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,661
The Kongs will never agree.

324
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:42,639
I can convince him.

325
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:45,115
I'll leave for the Jungle Kingdom,
in the morning.

326
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,964
Good luck, Princess.

327
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:49,793
For all our sakes.

328
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:03,288
Princess...

329
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:08,616
Princess, I...

330
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:13,570
Wait!
Release him.

331
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:19,716
Are you...

332
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:22,809
He's a human!

333
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,597
I mean...
You are human, right?

334
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:27,124
- It's just, you're so small.
- Hey!

335
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:28,777
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's go back.

336
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:30,115
Where did you come from?

337
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:32,396
Me and my little brother, Luigi.

338
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:34,029
We fell down this pipe.

339
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:36,741
And now, he's lost,
somewhere in the Dark Lands.

340
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:40,656
Then, it's only a matter of time
until he's captured by Bowser.

341
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:42,028
But you're in luck.

342
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:43,806
I'm on my way to stop him.

343
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,379
Well, take me with you.

344
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,954
This guy's a lunatic.

345
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:48,391
A psycho.

346
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,530
He will eat you for breakfast.

347
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:52,623
He won't even notice it probably.

348
00:26:52,648 --> 00:26:55,366
Cause you're very, very small.

349
00:26:55,391 --> 00:26:57,375
You know what,
make fun of me all you want.

350
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,278
But you're gonna help me find my brother.

351
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:02,108
Please?

352
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:04,900
Okay.

353
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,694
Let's see what you're made of.

354
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:08,999
Is that a yes?

355
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:09,680
No.

356
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:13,188
That's a, "Let's see what you're made of".

357
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:03,390
If you can finish this,

358
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,803
you're coming with me.

359
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:06,588
Watch and learn.

360
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,085
That was amazing.

361
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,745
Wait...

362
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,266
How am I supposed to do that?

363
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:54,671
With the power-up.

364
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:57,078
They give a special ability.

365
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,325
Ugh!

366
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,345
Really?!

367
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,252
Go on...

368
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:03,304
Eat it.

369
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,922
Ugh!

370
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:09,541
Now, this has to be a mushroom?

371
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:11,883
Cause I just,
hate mushrooms and...

372
00:29:11,907 --> 00:29:13,773
Okay, okay...

373
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:16,405
Are you sure
there's not like a...

374
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,778
Down the hatch!
Yep, there it is. And all gone.

375
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,388
Not cool!

376
00:29:38,956 --> 00:29:40,034
I'm tall.

377
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,248
And strong.

378
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:45,654
And, you can jump.

379
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:48,963
I got this.
No problem.

380
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:02,694
Oh, yeah.

381
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:05,212
When you get hit,
you lose the power.

382
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,338
Great...

383
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:13,634
Come on, try again.

384
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,551
Well...

385
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:30,896
We have a long journey
ahead of us, moustache.

386
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:32,124
But I didn't make it.

387
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:33,517
You almost did.

388
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,282
No one gets it right away.

389
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:37,277
How many tries did it take you?

390
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:39,282
Oh! So many...

391
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:41,440
I was not good at it.

392
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:42,999
Worse than you.

393
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:44,557
You got it right away, didn't you?

394
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:47,125
I got it right away, but I grew up here.

395
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:47,763
Okay.

396
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:49,369
Now, you're just trying
to make me feel better.

397
00:31:49,394 --> 00:31:50,585
No!

398
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,229
No...

399
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,179
Is it working?

400
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,520
A little bit, yeah.

401
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,450
My army!

402
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,325
Koopas!

403
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,896
Goombas!

404
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:33,055
Whatever those things are.

405
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,235
After years of searching for
the Super Star, it is finally ours!

406
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:42,150
I am now, the most
powerful turtle in the world!

407
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,910
Soon, we will arrive at
the Mushroom Kingdom.

408
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:49,786
Where after years of being sworn enemies,

409
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:55,113
I will ask their princess to
marry me in a fairy tale wedding!

410
00:32:57,448 --> 00:32:59,195
Yeah...

411
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,375
Did he say marry their princess?

412
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:03,046
Doesn't she hate you?

413
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:05,153
Of course, she hates me.

414
00:33:05,178 --> 00:33:07,833
But that makes me love her, all the more.

415
00:33:07,858 --> 00:33:09,838
Her heart-shaped bangs.

416
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,333
The way she floats in the breeze.

417
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,561
Her immovable tiara.

418
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:16,619
And when she sees this Star...

419
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:19,666
Oh, ho, ho, ho,
wedding bells.

420
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:21,490
Well, what if she says no?

421
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:28,036
Then, I will power up with this Star
and destroy the Mushroom Kingdom.

422
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:32,020
Prepare yourselves
for the best wedding ever.

423
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,613
It's gonna rock!

424
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:46,448
They're all counting on us.

425
00:34:46,473 --> 00:34:48,239
No pressure.

426
00:35:00,023 --> 00:35:01,258
My toads!

427
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:04,278
Our days of terror are almost over.

428
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,360
With the help of the Kong Army,

429
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,106
we will stop...

430
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:10,206
Uh...
Who's he?

431
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,316
He's not important!

432
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,463
Nervous?

433
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:33,456
Who, me?

434
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:34,984
Yes...

435
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:35,790

What?

463
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:39,456
A report from our intelligence.

464
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:43,898
A mustachioed human has
arrived in the Mushroom Kingdom.

465
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,366
The princess has been training him.

466
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,911
They are up to something, sire.

467
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,225
Sit...

468
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,943
Jam with me.

469
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:01,829
This human...

470
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:03,423
Where did he come from?

471
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,447
We...

472
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:06,020
aren't sure?

473
00:38:06,044 --> 00:38:08,770
Does the princess like him?

474
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:09,790
Sire...

475
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:11,300
Look in the mirror!

476
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,705
You have nothing to worry about.

477
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,721
I know that.

478
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:16,480
I'm not threatened.

479
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:22,695
Find out who he is,
and what they're plotting!

480
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,935
I'm on it, sire.

481
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,168
May I lift the cover?

482
00:38:27,193 --> 00:38:28,115
Not yet.

483
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,316
Pain is the best teacher.

484
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:42,886
Thinking about your brother?

485
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:45,399
We've never been apart this long.

486
00:38:45,546 --> 00:38:46,699
Don't worry...

487
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,165
We're going to save him.

488
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:06,962
You don't seem,
like you're from here.

489
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:09,676
I don't know where I'm from.

490
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,723
Really?

491
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:12,025
Yep.

492
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,334
My earliest memory is arriving.

493
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,229
I was so lucky they found me.

494
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:26,156
They took me in...

495
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,033
Raised me, like one of their own...

496
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:33,421
And, when I was ready...

497
00:39:33,446 --> 00:39:37,400
they made me their princess.

498
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,736
Hey, maybe, you're from my world.

499
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:49,911
There's a huge universe out there,
with a lot of galaxies.

500
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,026
We found him in the Dark Lands.

501
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,698
Leave him to me.

502
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,523
What is your name?

503
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:54,676
Uh...

504
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:56,050
Luigi.

505
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,290
Not sure if you know who I am,

506
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:02,963
but I'm about to marry
a princess and rule the world.

507
00:41:03,396 --> 00:41:04,256
Wow!

508
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:06,329
Yay...

509
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:10,176
But there's one problem, Luigi.

510
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,256
There's a human
traveling with my fiancée.

511
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:16,451
Has a mustache,
just like you.

512
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,151
Do you know him?

513
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,264
No.

514
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,236
No!

515
00:41:20,316 --> 00:41:22,264
Ah! A tough one, I see.

516
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:24,000
Maybe, this will get you to talk.

517
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:27,239
Do you think I know every
human being with a mustache,

518
00:41:27,264 --> 00:41:31,275
wearing an identical outfit, with a hat
with the letter of his first name on it?

519
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,760
Because I don't.

520
00:41:34,303 --> 00:41:36,266
- Do you know him?!
- Yes!

521
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:37,246
Stop! Stop!

522
00:41:37,271 --> 00:41:38,204
That's how I know him.

523
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:38,989
Yes, I know him.

524
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:40,440
Yeah.
He's my brother, Mario.

525
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,973
And he's the best guy in the world!

526
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:45,565
Do princesses find him attractive?

527
00:41:45,884 --> 00:41:48,750
They do, if we have good teeth!

528
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:51,839
Get him out of my sight!

529
00:41:51,864 --> 00:41:56,264
We'll see how tough this Mario is,
when he watches me kill his brother!

530
00:42:08,716 --> 00:42:10,676
Where am I?

531
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:15,943
Home.

532
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:17,950
Pay him no heed.

533
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,951
He is cute,
but he is...

534
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:26,376
In an insane world,
it is the sane who is called crazy.

535
00:42:31,143 --> 00:42:32,711
How long you guys been in here?

536
00:42:32,736 --> 00:42:33,691
Time...

537
00:42:33,716 --> 00:42:36,243
Like hope, is an illusion.

538
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:38,348
Please, we are depressed enough!

539
00:42:38,715 --> 00:42:40,596
There's gotta be a way out of here.

540
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:42,176
There's no escape.

541
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,874
The only hope,

542
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:46,241
is the sweet relief of death.

543
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:47,200
No!

544
00:42:47,225 --> 00:42:49,600
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

545
00:43:13,578 --> 00:43:14,671
You ready?

546
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:15,418
Eh...

547
00:43:15,443 --> 00:43:16,596
Sure?

548
00:43:25,356 --> 00:43:27,110
What...

549
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,291
How you doing?

550
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:32,030
We are here to see the king.

551
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,323
Follow me.

552
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:38,604
That gorilla's
wearing a sports cup.

553
00:43:38,628 --> 00:43:40,383
I feel underdressed.

554
00:43:45,643 --> 00:43:46,776
Hop in.

555
00:44:58,043 --> 00:45:01,270
Oh, by all means, come in.

556
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:15,558
Great and mighty Cranky Kong.

557
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:18,423
So, I heard you want my army.

558
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:21,123
Yes, your Highness.

559
00:45:21,148 --> 00:45:25,094
Without your help,
the Mushroom Kingdom will be annihilated.

560
00:45:26,094 --> 00:45:30,434
What makes you think,
you're worthy of fighting alongside,

561
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:35,463
the greatest army in the world!

562
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:37,310
Because we have heart.

563
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:38,910
And with your strength...

564
00:45:38,935 --> 00:45:40,795
We can win.

565
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,575
Okay, fine.

566
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,403
That's it?

567
00:45:43,428 --> 00:45:44,836
No, that's not it.

568
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:46,696
The answer is no.

569
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:47,534
Goodbye.

570
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,422
If the Mushroom Kingdom falls,

571
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,189
the Jungle Kingdom is next.

572
00:45:51,214 --> 00:45:54,830
We're not leaving,
without your army.

573
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,271
Who is this guy?

574
00:45:59,296 --> 00:46:00,936
Oh, he makes me laugh.

575
00:46:02,683 --> 00:46:04,665
Alright, tough guy.

576
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,458
You want my army so badly.

577
00:46:07,483 --> 00:46:12,845
Defeat my son,
in the great ring of Kong!

578
00:46:14,536 --> 00:46:15,990
Give us a second.

579
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:18,778
This is a really, really bad idea.

580
00:46:18,803 --> 00:46:20,876
Well, do you have another way
to save my brother?

581
00:46:21,086 --> 00:46:23,208
Are you two done whispering?

582
00:46:23,233 --> 00:46:25,006
It's a little rude.

583
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:29,074
You, sir, have a deal.

584
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:31,687
I'll fight your son, and win.

585
00:46:31,712 --> 00:46:33,535
I'm sure you will.

586
00:47:23,323 --> 00:47:25,562
I'm DK.

587
00:47:25,587 --> 00:47:27,556
I'm Donkey Kong.

588
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,900
Oh, yeah.

589
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:31,630
Hi, dad!

590
00:47:31,655 --> 00:47:32,788
No, don't!

591
00:47:32,813 --> 00:47:34,096
Don't do that!

592
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:35,496
Dad, wave back!

593
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:37,669
Enough with the showboating!

594
00:47:37,694 --> 00:47:39,747
What do you mean?!
They like it!

595
00:47:39,772 --> 00:47:41,529
It's what they came here for!

596
00:47:41,553 --> 00:47:43,709
Dancing pecs!

597
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:46,581
Okay, simmer down.

598
00:47:46,606 --> 00:47:48,601
I said, simmer down!

599
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:49,526
DK! DK!

600
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:51,248
That means you, Diddy Kong!

601
00:47:51,272 --> 00:47:52,141
D...

602
00:47:52,165 --> 00:47:53,340
Sorry.

603
00:47:53,365 --> 00:47:54,286
Now...

604
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:58,458
Since I want this fight to
last more than five seconds,

605
00:47:58,482 --> 00:48:01,653
I put power-ups
around the arena.

606
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:03,625
You're welcome, Mario.

607
00:48:03,656 --> 00:48:08,788
I don't need anything special
to break every bone in your tiny body.

608
00:48:16,881 --> 00:48:17,854
All right.

609
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:31,173
Oh, my...

610
00:48:31,198 --> 00:48:32,093
Okay...

611
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,346
Guess you're not getting my army.

612
00:48:39,565 --> 00:48:41,805
Is this what you came for?!

613
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:43,805
I love you, DK!

614
00:48:46,148 --> 00:48:48,495
Hi, dad!
Love you!

615
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:56,710
It is on,
like Donkey Kong!

616
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:06,116
You're about to pick on
someone, your own size.

617
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:22,904
I guess, he got the wrong mushroom.

618
00:49:45,084 --> 00:49:46,225
Get up, Mario!

619
00:50:13,473 --> 00:50:14,713
Had enough?

620
00:50:14,738 --> 00:50:18,013
Not even close.

621
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:31,443
Mario...

622
00:50:31,616 --> 00:50:34,282
It's-a me...

623
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:36,836
The box...

624
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,568
He looks adorable.

625
00:50:56,593 --> 00:50:57,833
He really does.

626
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:00,703
Oh, what?
I'm a cat?

627
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,636
You got the cat box!

628
00:51:03,216 --> 00:51:03,956
Oh, my...

629
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:06,611
Oh, I'm sorry...

630
00:51:06,636 --> 00:51:07,471
I'm sorry.

631
00:51:07,496 --> 00:51:08,430
Okay...

632
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,361
Now, you die.

633
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,130
I'm a cat.

634
00:51:21,336 --> 00:51:23,109
Meow.

635
00:51:55,366 --> 00:51:56,819
Had enough?

636
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:01,039
Not even close.

637
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:05,006
I'll take that as a yes.

638
00:52:12,655 --> 00:52:13,603
Yes!

639
00:52:13,627 --> 00:52:15,181
That's my best friend!

640
00:52:15,205 --> 00:52:19,118
Mario! Mario! Mario!

641
00:52:19,142 --> 00:52:21,655
Yeah, yeah...

642
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,394
That was incredible!

643
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:31,600
He kept beating you senseless,
and you just kept getting back up?

644
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,611
You just don't know when to quit.

645
00:52:33,636 --> 00:52:34,316
Huh...

646
00:52:34,341 --> 00:52:36,245
Well, never thought of that
as a good thing.

647
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,194
It's a great thing.

648
00:52:38,476 --> 00:52:39,358
Thanks.

649
00:52:39,383 --> 00:52:40,271
I...

650
00:52:40,295 --> 00:52:42,631
I let him win,
just for the record.

651
00:52:42,656 --> 00:52:44,469
Really, though?
Why would you do that?

652
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,764
You want to know why?

653
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:48,863
It's, mind your own business,
that's why!

654
00:52:48,888 --> 00:52:50,063
Alright, giant monkey.

655
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:51,473
Enough!

656
00:52:51,498 --> 00:52:53,055
Get inside!

657
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,300
We've located Bowser's ship.

658
00:52:57,325 --> 00:53:01,453
He's gonna arrive at
the Mushroom Kingdom, by sundown.

659
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,111
Lucky for you, guys.

660
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:04,908
I got a shortcut.

661
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:07,743
We beat him there and ambush him.

662
00:53:08,305 --> 00:53:10,326
Yeah, I know.

663
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:14,271
That's why, we're gonna need karts!

664
00:53:31,944 --> 00:53:33,790
Well, what are you waiting for?

665
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:37,451
Pick your karts!

666
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:37,790
I hate you.

667
00:54:37,815 --> 00:54:41,903
To the Mushroom Kingdom,
and the biggest fight of our lives.

668
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:43,890
Here we go!

669
00:55:02,326 --> 00:55:04,201
Princess Peach...

670
00:55:04,226 --> 00:55:05,975
Here we are...

671
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,743
I guess, love really makes
a guy come out of his shell.

672
00:55:13,656 --> 00:55:16,771
Let's rule the world, together.

673
00:55:16,795 --> 00:55:18,044
Forever...

674
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:20,229
Will you marry me?

675
00:55:20,253 --> 00:55:21,866
Oh, yes!

676
00:55:24,206 --> 00:55:25,133
What?!

677
00:55:25,332 --> 00:55:28,503
We have found the princess
and the mustachioed human.

678
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:32,656
He has defeated Donkey Kong,
and won the Kong Army.

679
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:34,798
So, like Peach was
super impressed?

680
00:55:34,822 --> 00:55:36,660
It appears so, yes.

681
00:55:36,685 --> 00:55:38,960
They are heading
toward the secret passage!

682
00:55:38,984 --> 00:55:41,601
Oh, they think
they can surprise me, huh?

683
00:55:41,626 --> 00:55:43,780
Two can play at that game.

684
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:06,771
Um...

685
00:56:06,803 --> 00:56:10,183
No one panic,
but the road is about to end.

686
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:14,316
Well then, you better step
on the gas and buckle up!

687
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:44,451
Woo-hoo!

688
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:47,911
Is there anything like this, in your world?

689
00:56:47,936 --> 00:56:48,958
What?!

690
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:52,290
Is there anything like this, in your world?!

691
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,218
No...

692
00:56:54,243 --> 00:56:56,313
We don't drive on rainbows.

693
00:56:56,338 --> 00:56:58,053
What are you gonna tell me next?

694
00:56:58,078 --> 00:56:59,744
That the turtles aren't evil?

695
00:56:59,769 --> 00:57:00,831
No, no.

696
00:57:00,856 --> 00:57:02,262
They're usually pets.

697
00:57:02,287 --> 00:57:03,569
No way!

698
00:57:03,594 --> 00:57:05,582
Yeah! Come to Brooklyn,
I'll buy you a turtle.

699
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,533
Maybe, I will.

700
00:57:09,086 --> 00:57:10,854
Dude, is this you flirting?!

701
00:57:10,879 --> 00:57:11,923
This is painful!

702
00:57:11,948 --> 00:57:13,500
Listen, I was trying to be nice.

703
00:57:13,525 --> 00:57:15,116
You are so embarrassing!

704
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,441
A princess would never go out with you!

705
00:57:17,465 --> 00:57:18,381
Yes, she would!

706
00:57:18,406 --> 00:57:19,667
I guarantee, she would!

707
00:57:19,692 --> 00:57:20,656
Guys!

708
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:21,521
Enough!

709
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,641
Alright, alright.

710
00:57:32,451 --> 00:57:33,916
Charge!

711
00:57:43,311 --> 00:57:44,410
It's an ambush!

712
00:57:47,337 --> 00:57:49,523
Defensive position!

713
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,000
Mario...

714
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:08,579
You're a dead man!

715
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:12,576
Split up!

716
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:16,310
Mario!

717
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:35,181
Haha!

718
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:34,560
I'm too cute to die!

719
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:46,969
That is how you princess!

720
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:00,735
Time to die, Mario.

721
01:00:21,616 --> 01:00:23,296
See ya!

722
01:00:23,856 --> 01:00:25,176
No!

723
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:30,059
Woo-hoo!

724
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:30,870
Haha!

725
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:32,216
Yeah!

726
01:00:38,918 --> 01:00:42,093
You, can't escape me.

727
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:43,231
What?

728
01:00:43,757 --> 01:00:46,417
Blue shell!

729
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,096
No!

730
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:04,316
No, Mario...

731
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:06,714
No!

732
01:01:06,936 --> 01:01:07,878
No...

733
01:01:07,903 --> 01:01:09,203
No!

734
01:01:09,228 --> 01:01:10,023
Oh, no!

735
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:11,879
No...

736
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:17,106
Get your clown claws off of me!

737
01:01:20,435 --> 01:01:21,998
Goodbye, Mario.

738
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:24,323
We have to get home.

739
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:33,875
Hey, this is your fault!

740
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,844
My fault?

741
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:36,211
- You're the one...
- Stop talking!

742
01:01:36,236 --> 01:01:39,762
I don't want the last thing I hear,
before I die, to be your...

743
01:02:10,203 --> 01:02:11,851
Mario...

744
01:02:11,883 --> 01:02:13,349
You saved my life.

745
01:02:13,374 --> 01:02:14,411
Yeah, well...

746
01:02:14,436 --> 01:02:15,570
I won't tell anyone.

747
01:02:15,595 --> 01:02:17,204
Good, please don't.

748
01:02:17,228 --> 01:02:17,983
Okay...

749
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:20,781
Uh...

750
01:02:20,806 --> 01:02:23,361
Did you just feel something?

751
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:26,483
Swim!

752
01:02:43,903 --> 01:02:45,389
Browser's on his way.

753
01:02:45,414 --> 01:02:47,391
You have to evacuate.

754
01:02:49,634 --> 01:02:50,355
Hurry!

755
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,541
Get out of the city!

756
01:03:05,203 --> 01:03:06,523
Princess?

757
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:10,763
We lost the Army,
and Mario's gone.

758
01:03:12,553 --> 01:03:14,648
Bowser is coming.

759
01:03:14,673 --> 01:03:15,886
Head into the forest!

760
01:03:15,911 --> 01:03:17,400
I'll buy you some time.

761
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:18,510
You heard her!

762
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:21,230
Evacuate the city!

763
01:03:21,996 --> 01:03:23,250
Go with the others.

764
01:03:23,275 --> 01:03:25,901
I said, I wouldn't let anyone hurt you.

765
01:03:35,925 --> 01:03:38,061
Just leave it!
There's no time!

766
01:04:32,905 --> 01:04:35,253
Princess Peach...

767
01:04:35,278 --> 01:04:37,611
Brave as ever.

768
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:43,083
As you can see,
I have the Super Star.

769
01:04:43,108 --> 01:04:45,641
If you're going to use it...

770
01:04:45,666 --> 01:04:47,301
Use it now!

771
01:04:49,946 --> 01:04:51,526
No, Princess...

772
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:54,348
I stole this Star for us.

773
01:04:54,373 --> 01:04:58,563
I guess, love really makes
a guy come out of his shell.

774
01:05:00,693 --> 01:05:02,795
I told you that line wouldn't work.

775
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,841
You're doing great!

776
01:05:04,865 --> 01:05:09,473
Peaches, with this Star,
we will be invincible.

777
01:05:09,498 --> 01:05:13,838
We can rule the world together, forever.

778
01:05:13,863 --> 01:05:15,643
Will you marry me?

779
01:05:15,903 --> 01:05:17,300
Marry you?

780
01:05:17,325 --> 01:05:18,724
Are you insane?!

781
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:20,986
I would never marry you!

782
01:05:21,506 --> 01:05:23,933
Maybe, you should reconsider.

783
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:27,581
No!

784
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:30,147
Stop!

785
01:05:31,025 --> 01:05:32,132
Please, stop!

786
01:05:32,157 --> 01:05:35,143
I'll marry you,
just don't hurt my toads!

787
01:05:40,285 --> 01:05:41,911
You have my word.

788
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,890
Haha, time for a wedding!

789
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:06,385
♪ Life is sad ♪

790
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:08,058
♪ Prison is sad ♪

791
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:13,309
♪ Life and prison is very, very sad ♪

792
01:06:19,548 --> 01:06:22,428
Ooh, fresh meat for the grinder.

793
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:25,021
Who's this ray of sunshine?

794
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:26,619
There's no sunshine...

795
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:28,067
only darkness.

796
01:06:28,097 --> 01:06:30,379
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

797
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,691
Hello, prisoners...

798
01:06:32,716 --> 01:06:37,536
You don't deserve this, but you're
invited to the Royal Wedding!

799
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,040
Yay!

800
01:06:39,065 --> 01:06:43,072
Where you will all be
ritualistically sacrificed.

801
01:06:45,997 --> 01:06:47,505
Oh, no, no, no.

802
01:06:47,529 --> 01:06:49,963
Finally, mercy.

803
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:53,116
Mario...

804
01:07:06,035 --> 01:07:07,355
So, this is the end...

805
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,283
Being slowly digested by an eel,
next to an idiot in overalls.

806
01:07:11,308 --> 01:07:14,008
Well, at least, your brother
isn't gonna die because of you.

807
01:07:14,033 --> 01:07:16,661
Least, you're not gonna die,
with your dad thinking you're a joke.

808
01:07:17,163 --> 01:07:19,636
Yeah, well, my dad thinks I'm a joke too.

809
01:07:19,816 --> 01:07:21,636
Yeah, well...

810
01:07:21,661 --> 01:07:22,703
Your dad's right!

811
01:07:22,728 --> 01:07:24,591
You know what,
I feel bad enough.

812
01:07:24,616 --> 01:07:25,895
Just, just, leave me alone.

813
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,406
I've never met your dad,
but he sounds brilliant!

814
01:07:28,431 --> 01:07:31,657
Just go in a corner and
smash some stuff, smash monkey.

815
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:38,761
I, am, more, than a guy,
who smashes things!

816
01:08:06,862 --> 01:08:08,162
That was amazing!

817
01:08:08,187 --> 01:08:11,790
Now, we're even.

818
01:08:39,186 --> 01:08:40,181
Princess...

819
01:08:40,206 --> 01:08:41,121
I got it!

820
01:08:41,146 --> 01:08:42,159
Great job.

821
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,959
Couldn't have you going out
there without your bouquet.

822
01:08:44,984 --> 01:08:46,479
It's perfect.

823
01:09:13,626 --> 01:09:15,899
I'll be sacrificing them in your honor.

824
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:18,880
Lower the prisoners!

825
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:28,727
Dearly beloved...

826
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:30,660
Huh?

827
01:09:30,684 --> 01:09:32,334
Drama...

828
01:09:32,358 --> 01:09:34,878
You really thought
I'd marry you?

829
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:36,473
Kinda...

830
01:09:36,497 --> 01:09:38,978
I'd never marry a monster.

831
01:09:40,796 --> 01:09:43,671
Then we are breaking up, right now!

832
01:10:08,821 --> 01:10:10,248
They gotta be up there.

833
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,207
Fire!

834
01:10:22,814 --> 01:10:23,895
You wanna do this?

835
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,408
Yes, I do.

836
01:10:34,865 --> 01:10:35,631
Yes!

837
01:10:35,662 --> 01:10:37,290
Fire!

838
01:10:53,235 --> 01:10:54,488
This is fun!

839
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:57,370
Ha, loser!

840
01:11:02,074 --> 01:11:03,470
Hey, what does this do?

841
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,488
Cool raccoon suit.

842
01:11:14,513 --> 01:11:16,306
- Really?
- Not at all!

843
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:50,950
Whee!

844
01:12:04,627 --> 01:12:06,100
Boo...

845
01:12:18,563 --> 01:12:20,795
- Lou!
- Mario?!

846
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:25,378
I told ya!

847
01:12:25,403 --> 01:12:25,890
See...

848
01:12:25,915 --> 01:12:29,830
As long as we're together,
everything is gonna be okay.

849
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:34,813
Mario, why do you look like a bear?
What is this?

850
01:12:38,846 --> 01:12:40,614
Ya did good, kid.

851
01:12:40,645 --> 01:12:43,328
Make your pecs dance,
you deserve it.

852
01:12:43,353 --> 01:12:45,846
No time now.
Definitely, later.

853
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,340
Launch the Bomber Bill and
destroy the Mushroom Kingdom!

854
01:13:14,466 --> 01:13:16,367
No...

855
01:13:23,477 --> 01:13:24,490
Hey, hey...

856
01:13:24,522 --> 01:13:25,564
Hey, over here.

857
01:13:36,756 --> 01:13:38,576
You asked for it.

858
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:48,156
Hello...

859
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:13,569
Really?

860
01:14:18,463 --> 01:14:19,810
Follow me.

861
01:14:25,599 --> 01:14:26,833
Come on...

862
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:31,763
Little closer...

863
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:35,086
Mamma Mia!

864
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:46,993
Huh?

865
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:15,278
That's beautiful.

866
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:16,089
You make this right.

867
01:15:18,893 --> 01:15:20,632
Huh?

868
01:15:40,247 --> 01:15:42,853
Huh?

869
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:44,293
Brooklyn?

870
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:47,286
Mario?!

871
01:15:48,026 --> 01:15:49,180
You almost dented my...

872
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,276
Mario!

873
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,860
Don't you want this?

874
01:16:42,073 --> 01:16:44,415
You ruined my wedding!

875
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,193
I was finally gonna be happy!

876
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,855
Now, you will suffer...

877
01:16:51,879 --> 01:16:54,220
like me!

878
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:12,235
You really thought you could stop me?

879
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:15,253
You worthless, weak little nothing.

880
01:17:15,593 --> 01:17:17,281
Come out and fight!

881
01:17:17,305 --> 01:17:19,436
Or are you too scared?

882
01:17:24,116 --> 01:17:25,440
Just what I thought.

883
01:17:44,043 --> 01:17:46,111
Mamma Mia!

884
01:17:46,136 --> 01:17:48,803
That's why the
Super Mario Brothers are here.

885
01:17:48,828 --> 01:17:50,276
Out to save Brooklyn...

886
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:51,323
Save Brooklyn...

887
01:17:51,348 --> 01:17:52,121
Brooklyn...

888
01:17:52,146 --> 01:17:53,341
Save Brooklyn...

889
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:13,236
Let's-a go.

890
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:19,763
Hey!

891
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:22,290
Leave him alone.

892
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,590
Mario...

893
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:27,570
You just don't know when you quit.

894
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:29,023
Yeah...

895
01:18:29,048 --> 01:18:30,474
I've been told that before.

896
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:35,164
Mario!

897
01:18:38,155 --> 01:18:40,401
The Star!

898
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:41,154
No!

899
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:42,314
That's mine!

900
01:19:02,841 --> 01:19:03,601
Lou...

901
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:08,810
Nothing can hurt us,
as long as we're together.

902
01:19:19,523 --> 01:19:20,663
No!

903
01:19:42,099 --> 01:19:44,139
Rip 'em to pieces!

904
01:19:56,115 --> 01:19:57,810
Oh, hey, Spike.

905
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:58,770
Luigi?!

906
01:20:16,635 --> 01:20:18,156
Mamma Mia.

907
01:21:09,215 --> 01:21:10,141
Peaches...

908
01:21:11,966 --> 01:21:13,506
Listen, this is not the way I pictured it,

909
01:21:13,531 --> 01:21:15,263
but give me one more chance.

910
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:17,431
Ew, no.

911
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:18,843
No, no, no, no.

912
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,222
Hey...

913
01:21:21,246 --> 01:21:21,944
Hey!

914
01:21:21,969 --> 01:21:23,436
That is not cool!

915
01:21:23,696 --> 01:21:25,769
Ah, he got the blue mushroom!

916
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:26,562
See...

917
01:21:26,587 --> 01:21:28,150
Told you, I'd get you a pet turtle.

918
01:21:29,003 --> 01:21:31,076
Not bad, mustache.

919
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:34,311
And Luigi,
you're so brave.

920
01:21:34,336 --> 01:21:35,625
Oh, thanks.

921
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:37,244
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

922
01:21:37,276 --> 01:21:39,004
Ah, my boys!

923
01:21:39,029 --> 01:21:41,905
- My heroes!
- Wahoo!

924
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:42,796
Mario...

925
01:21:42,821 --> 01:21:44,276
You were amazing!

926
01:21:45,806 --> 01:21:47,426
Thanks, dad.

927
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:51,016
Ah, bring it in!

928
01:21:56,598 --> 01:22:01,673
Let's hear it, for
the Super Mario Brothers!

929
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,846
These are my boys!

930
01:22:11,871 --> 01:22:13,860
Ha-hey!

931
01:22:14,403 --> 01:22:16,010

Or is it?

937
01:23:21,766 --> 01:23:23,701
Because everything's over now.

938
01:23:23,725 --> 01:23:28,398
And all that's left is you
and the infinite void.

Kind of makes you
